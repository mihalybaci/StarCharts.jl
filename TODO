These are some ideas for future improvements
####################

- GUI builder for making charts
- Pop-up window to show current LST, GMST, UTC, etc.
- Save and load charts and chart data with BSON?
- Build a default chart to include:
    - All naked eye stars
    - All planets
    - All Messier objects
    - "Binocular bright" NGC objects?
    - The ecliptic
    - the Galacic center
    - North/South Celestial Poles (as plus signs)
    - some kind of low border since in practice seeing to 
      the horizon is not possible
    - Date of the chart
    - Maybe 2 or 3 future dates with the same alt/az
- Add a Chart type to store information to avoid recalculating 
  values where possible. The struct fields should include:
    - datetime
    - GMST
    - LST
    - LHA
    - ecliptic
    - Celestial equator
    - List of Celestial objects
- Include constellation lines (connecting the stars)
- Include constellation areas (outlined the deined region)\
- Find a way to download data from Simbad and store the result
    - all naked eye objects (vmag < 6)
    - all planets
    - all Messier objects
    - Notable NGC objects
- Different charts with estimtaes based on telescope size
- Zoom in maps on specific regions of sky
- moonglow, transparent gray zone for 
- Sunrise/sunset
- Twilight times
    - nautical
    - civil 
    - astronomical
- Have chart and legend on page 1, print notable info page 2
- Proper motion calculations
