These are some ideas for future improvements
####################

- GUI builder for making charts
- Pop-up window to show current LST, GMST, UTC, etc.
- Save and load charts and chart data with BSON?
- Build a default chart to include:
    - All naked eye stars
    - All planets
    - All Messier objects
    - "Binocular bright" NGC objects?
    - The ecliptic
    - the Galacic center
    - North/South Celestial Poles (as plus signs)
    - some kind of low border since in practice seeing to 
      the horizon is not possible
    - Date of the chart
    - Maybe 2 or 3 future dates with the same alt/az
