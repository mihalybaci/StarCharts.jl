These are some ideas for future improvements
####################

- GUI builder for making charts
- Pop-up window to show current LST, GMST, UTC, etc.
- Save and load charts and chart data with BSON?
- Build a default chart to include:
    - All naked eye stars
    - All planets
    - All Messier objects
    - "Binocular bright" NGC objects?
    - The ecliptic
    - the Galacic center
    - North/South Celestial Poles (as plus signs)
    - some kind of low border since in practice seeing to 
      the horizon is not possible
    - Date of the chart
    - Maybe 2 or 3 future dates with the same alt/az
- Add a Chart type to store information to avoid recalculating 
  values where possible. The struct fields should include:
    - datetime
    - GMST
    - LST
    - LHA
    - ecliptic
    - Celestial equator
    - List of Celestial objects
- Include constellation lines (connecting the stars)
- Include constellation areas (outlined the deined region)
